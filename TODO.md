## Can we use a database? What for? SQL or NoSQL?
Not really nessary at this point, but for caching or storing searched Gists and rate limiter NoSQL like redis is a good option
## How can we protect the api from abusing it?
By implementing rate limiter, API throttling, IP blacklisting and API authentication (API keys, OAuth tokens, or JWT). 
For rate limiter e.g.,
```python
from flask_limiter import Limiter
from flask_limiter.util import get_remote_address

limiter = Limiter(
    key_func=get_remote_address,
    default_limits=["200 per day", "50 per hour"]
    # By default, Flask-Limiter uses an in-memory storage, which is not suitable for a production environment 
    
    # One could use a redis storage e.g., storage_uri="redis://localhost:6379 
)

@app.route("/api/v1/search", methods=["POST"])
@limiter.limit("10 per minute")
async def search():
```
## How can we deploy the application in a cloud environment?
Deploying the application in a cloud environment effectively is often best done using a CI/CD pipeline that includes a staging environment, as this allows for automated testing and deployment in a controlled manner that closely mimics the production environment.

## How can we be sure the application is alive and works as expected when deployed into a cloud environment?
To ensure the application is functioning correctly when deployed in a cloud environment, one should implement a health check endpoint (like ping route in this case), configure monitoring with logging(basic logging implemented in the code), and set up alerting with third parties like Slack.

## Any other topics you may find interesting and/or important to cover
* I would like to improve the poetry dependencies as now I get some warnings because of some particular versions of dependencies used
* I have implemented the error handling, but would like to improve it. Some errors returns HTML rather than json for now
* I would like to add at least rate limiter, and add a .config file for all the configurations including logging configurations. 
* Also, the concurrency for asyncio could be controlled with a semaphore in utils.py
